Current Version: 1.4.3

Version 1.4.3 (2018-10-08) -
    - Implimented the "--hold", "--unhold", "--comment", and "--restore" flags
    - Added "-a" as an alias for "--backup-file"
    - The installation process writes the installation path to all of the executable files
        - Added the "--locate" flag to reproduce historical finctionality
    - Continued to add to functionality tests
    - Fixed assumptions even more. Added testing for them to verify that they work as intended now
    - Added the ability to use a different working directory (no use case outside of testing purposes)

Version 1.4.2 (2018-10-05) -
    - When files are backed up, they now capture ctime as well.
        - When comparing backups, if the md5sum was not checked, the ctime will be checked.
    - Removed the bits that assumed the possibility that md5.pm could be missing (except for with "--md5-test")
    - Only test for the necessary perl modules on the first run (and each run after a fresh install or update)
    - Now errors out when checking if a file exists (rather than returning a zero)
    - Better processing when given a relative filename instead of a absolute path
    - Prune functionality was failing to descend into the backup directory. Fixed it
    - Added the "--hold" flag for use with the "--backup-file" flag
        - If there is a file with a name matching a backed up file, plus the string "_hold", that file will be retained even if it would otherwise be pruned
    - Prune functionality will remove orphaned "_comment", "_ctime" and "_hold" files.
    - Added the "Nice" control string.
    - Added a configuration file and (hopefully) all of the bits necessary to appropriately use and manipulate that configuration file
    - Updated testing to run through stat_watch_wrap.sh instead of stat_watch.pl
    - Fixed a bug where assumptions were incorrectly triggering

Version 1.4.1 (2018-10-03) -
    - Added assumption functionality

Version 1.4.0 (2018-10-02) -
    - Routed all Stat Watch commands through the wrapper script
    - Separated out the wrapper script into a few smaller scripts
    - Moved help and version intofmation into separate files
    - Added the "--backup-file" flag and "--comment" flag
    - When requesting backups of a symlink, show backups of both the symlink and what it links to

Version 1.3.2 (2018-09-10) -
    - The expected install path is now /usr/local/stat_watch

Version 1.3.1 (2018-08-29) -
    - Fixed a bug where under some circumstances it would fail to find the list of backup directories
    - Added the "--new-lines" flag to output all file names that contain a new line character
    - Changed how help and version text is output
    - Job names are required to be unique
    - You can refer to the job either by the name or by the job file with "--run"
    - Added the "Email-Retain" control string

Version 1.3.0 (2018-08-24) -
    - Any time a file name is output (not including the "--record" report) The file name is appropriately escaped to show non-printing characters
    - Less liberal use of abs_path. There were definitely circumstances where I didn't need it but was using it anyway.
    - Added the "--links" flag to output the number of symlinks in each directory

Version 1.2.0 (2018-08-19) -
    - Added the "--md5" flag, as well as a few control strings
    - Added a maximum depth for the script to recurse to
        - The "--record" and "--diff" outputs now include instances where such directories are present
    - Split out help text so that you can reference individual bits of it
    - In "--diff" mode, check mtimes of the two reports we're comparing. Always make the newest file on the right for diff purposes
        - Added the "--before" and "--after" flags for "--diff" mode to override this behavior
    - When checking whether a file needs to be backed up, if the md5sum was captured initially, check against the md5sum of the backup as well.

Version 1.1.0 (2018-08-17) -
    - Added the ability to compare md5sums of files as well
    - Fixed a bug where files might be being matched against incorrectly due to an added slash
    - Added the ability to turn off error supression when running jobs
    - Added the ability to run helper-scripts during various phases of the Stat Watch job

Version 1.0.1 (2018-08-10) -
    - Added the ability to capture data on files with names that include a newline character
    - Liberal use of abs_path in hopes of ensuring that files are always referenced in the same manner
    - Added log trimming to prevent the log from going out of control (like Dave Coulier)

Version 1.0.0 (2018-08-04) -
