JOB FILES

There are a number of files assiciated with each Stat Watch job. Here is an explanation of each of them.

./backup_[JOB NAME]
    - This directory contains the backups of files as specified by the .job file

./[JOB NAME]_changes_[EPOCH STAMP].txt
    - When changes are detected, this is a copy of file that's sent to the customer describing those changes

./[JOB NAME]_files.txt
    - This is the most recent Stat Watch report that was generated

./[JOB NAME]_files2.txt
    - While the job is running, this file contians the most recent report, which is compared against ./[JOB NAME]_files.txt. At the end of the job, this file is moved to replace ./[JOB NAME]_files.txt

./[JOB NAME].job
    - This file defines how the job will function. It's the file that needs to be edited in order to make changes to the job.

./[JOB NAME].log
    - This file contains logs for everything that has occurred as part of the job. If the job expires and is removed as a result of the "Expire" control string, this is the only file that will be left afterward.

./[JOB NAME]_message_end.txt
    - If this file exists, its contents will be added to the VERY end of each email message sent.

./[JOB NAME]_message_foot.txt
    - If this file exists, its contents will be added to the end of each email message sent, before the statement that the script was generated by Stat Watch.

./[JOB NAME]_message_head.txt
    - If this file exists, its contents will be added to the beginning of each email message sent.

./[JOB NAME]_run
    - This directory is in place to indicate that the Stat Watch job is currently running and to prevent two jobs from running concurrently

./[JOB NAME]_run/epoch
    - This file contains the timstamp of when the currently running job started

./[JOB NAME]_run/pid
    - This file contains the process id of the current running job

./[JOB NAME]_stamp
    - This file contains the last timestamp of when ./[JOB NAME].job was modified. If the timestamp here doesn't match the timestamp of that file, a check is run to see if we're checking new files or directories that have not been backed up yet
